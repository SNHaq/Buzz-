    "story": "Once upon a time, there lived a tortoise and a flock of geese. Their home, which was the lake, was drying up, and the geese were planning on migrating to wetter lands. The tortoise was far too slow to migrate on his own, and so one of the geese, pitied him and offered to fly him to the wetter area they were going to. The tortoise happily accepted and was told to hold onto a stick. Two geese would hold on to either end of the stick, and this was how they would fly. The flight went smoothly until a few geese began to mock and taunt the tortoise for his weird way of transport. The tortoise wasn't happy and couldn't endure much more of these comments. The geese continued and then, the tortoise lost his nerve. 'Stop!' he exclaimed. And then he fell and he fell, and never got up once again. This only goes to show that sometimes ignoring others is best.",
